# Anomaly-Detection-System
There are five different files included in the repository. 
These are anomaly detection systems that detect 13 different types of DDoS attacks. 
An Anomaly Detection System learns from the patterns of past traffic and predict the future behaviour of the system.
CICDDoS2019 dataset has been used with around 1.3 million flows and 83 features.
Five different codes implementing Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, One Hidden Layer MLP with early stopping, One Hidden Layer MLP without early stopping and Multiple Hidden Layers MLP with 2 hidden layers of 128 neurons each are uploaded.
